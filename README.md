## üöÄ Setup and Installation (For Developers)

To run this project from the source code, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ziymaxcode/Invoice-System.git](https://github.com/ziymaxcode/Invoice-System.git)
    cd Invoice-System
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    A `requirements.txt` file is included for convenience.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main_app.py
    ```
    The first time you run it, a `hardware_store.db` file will be created automatically.

## üì¶ Building the Executable (`.exe`)

To package the application into a single executable file for distribution:

1.  Make sure you have all the necessary asset files in the project's root directory:
    - `logo.ico` (your application icon)
    - `DejaVuSans.ttf` (the font for PDF generation)

2.  Run the PyInstaller command from your terminal:
    ```bash
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --add-data "DejaVuSans.ttf;." --add-data "logo.ico;." main_app.py
    ```

3.  The final executable will be located in the `dist` folder.

## Usage

To run the application, simply double-click the `.exe` file.

**Important:** For the application to work correctly, the following files must be kept together in the same folder:
- `YourAppName.exe` (the main application)
- `hardware_store.db` (the database file, created on first run)
- `DejaVuSans.ttf` (the font for PDFs)
- `logo.ico` (the application icon)
